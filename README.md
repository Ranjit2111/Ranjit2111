# 👋 Hello there!

I'm **Ranjit N**, an aspiring AI/ML engineer currently pursuing an Integrated M.Sc. in Data Science. I specialize in building intelligent systems that transition seamlessly from concept to production. My work spans:

- **LLM-Powered Agents**: Multi-agent frameworks using LangChain and vector search.
- **Production ML**: Real-world pipelines with monitoring, retraining, and secure cloud deployment.
- **Full-Stack AI Applications**: FastAPI + Next.js + Tailwind CSS — from model to UI.
- **Deep Learning from Scratch**: Transformers, autoencoders, hybrid loss functions — built the hard way.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- 🌍 Turning multi-agent LLM demos into useful real-world tools  
- 🧠 Researching factual consistency in radiology report summarization with RE, NER & contrastive learning  
- ⚙️ Learning proper software engineering practices: modular Python, CI/CD, observability, logging  
- 💡 Experimenting with open-weight LLMs, LoRA fine-tuning, RAG pipelines  
- 🧱 Exploring backend engineering deeply and picking up **Go (Golang)** to build scalable, robust APIs

---

## ⚒️ How I Work

- I believe in **debuggable AI** — if you can't log, trace, or evaluate it, it’s just a toy.
- Every model I build is paired with **deployment, monitoring, and a frontend**.
- I avoid overengineering early. MVP > Complexity.  
- I like breaking things down and building them from scratch when needed — especially when learning.

---

## 🤝 Let's Connect & Collaborate

I’m actively looking for:
- AI/ML engineering internships (especially GenAI, MLOps, or backend-heavy)
- Research collabs in **medical NLP** or **LLM reliability**
- OSS projects in LangChain, vector DBs, or multi-agent frameworks
